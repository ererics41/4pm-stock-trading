## Project summary

### An app that displays information about stocks and provides recommendations to the user.

### One-sentence description of the project

A simple easy to use app that helps you make more informed stock-related decisions.

### Additional information about the project

This app displays a list of popular stocks and allows you to choose which ones you want to learn more about. Once you choose a stock, you will be able to see important information about it such as its current price per unit and a graph of its recent price history. In addition, the app will recommend stocks for you to buy based on your interests and specifications.

## Known Problems

* We are currently using Plotly to construct our graphs. However, every free account has a limit of 100 public graphs available. So, we must create a new account and input the new information into the top of 'graph.py' every time we run out of graphs for that account. We have used 3 (and counting) keys so far.

* <strike>The live stock information the graph is formatted such that it's height is set to 85% the max y-value. This (usually) formats it nicely but sometimes, the formatting will be off. (Also there's a problem including the dollar sign symbol in the HTML-python string). </strike> UPDATE: Fixed! Now using an offset based off the max range or in otherwords, I used MAX - 0.4 * (MAX-MIN). The offset is 40% the maxrange.
